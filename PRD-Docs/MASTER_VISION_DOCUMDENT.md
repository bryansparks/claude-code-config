## Development Approach

### Autonomous Execution Framework

**Vision-Driven Development:**
1. This document serves as the "north star"
2. All implementation decisions align with vision
3. Course-correct if drifting from principles
4. Update vision as learnings emerge

**Multi-Phase Autonomous Execution:**
1. Read [VISION_DOC] before each phase
2. Generate comprehensive implementation plan
3. Coordinate specialized agents in parallel
4. Execute with continuous testing
5. Validate deliverables against vision
6. Commit with vision-aligned messages
7. Report completion with next phase recommendations

**Specialized Agent Coordination:**
- **[Agent Type 1]:** [Responsibilities]
- **[Agent Type 2]:** [Responsibilities]
- **[Agent Type 3]:** [Responsibilities]

**Testing Strategy:**
- [Test type 1]: [Coverage requirements]
- [Test type 2]: [Coverage requirements]
- [Test type 3]: [Coverage requirements]

**Quality Gates:**
- [Gate 1]
- [Gate 2]
- [Gate 3]
