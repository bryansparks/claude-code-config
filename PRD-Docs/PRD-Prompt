# Vision Document Generation Prompt

Use this prompt to have Claude Code create comprehensive vision documents for your projects.

---

## Standard Prompt

```
I need you to create a comprehensive Master Vision Document for [PROJECT_NAME].

**Context:**
[Provide 2-3 paragraphs describing:
- What the project does
- Why it exists
- Current state vs desired state
- Key challenges or complexity]

**Scope:**
This vision document should cover:
- Strategic business objectives
- Complete architectural design
- Integration points with existing systems
- Phase-by-phase implementation roadmap
- Autonomous execution guidance for Claude Code
- Architecture decision rationale

**Document Requirements:**

1. **Structure:** Follow the template at [TEMPLATE_PATH]

2. **Detail Level:**
   - Executive Summary: Non-technical stakeholder level
   - Architecture: Senior engineer level with decision rationale
   - Workflows: Step-by-step with user experience + backend detail
   - Roadmap: Phased with timelines and success metrics

3. **Key Sections to Emphasize:**
   - [Section 1 you care most about]
   - [Section 2 you care most about]
   - [Section 3 you care most about]

4. **Autonomous Development Guidance:**
   - Include patterns for how Claude Code should execute each phase
   - Specify which specialized agents to coordinate
   - Define quality gates and testing requirements
   - Provide decision-making frameworks

5. **Integration Context:**
   Existing systems/components this must integrate with:
   - [System 1]: [Brief description and integration point]
   - [System 2]: [Brief description and integration point]
   - [System 3]: [Brief description and integration point]

6. **Technology Stack:**
   Current/preferred technologies:
   - Frontend: [List]
   - Backend: [List]
   - Data: [List]
   - Infrastructure: [List]

**Special Instructions:**
- This is a living document - design it for iterative updates
- Make architectural decisions explicit with rationale
- Include "Before/After" diagrams for major refactors
- Add checkboxes for success criteria that can be tracked
- Create actionable phase breakdowns with time estimates
- Flag any ambiguities or areas needing human decision

**Deliverable:**
A markdown document that can serve as the "north star" for autonomous development, providing enough context and structure that Claude Code can execute phases with minimal guidance.

## Specialized Prompts by Domain

### For New Greenfield Projects

```
Create a Master Vision Document for a NEW project called [PROJECT_NAME].

Since this is greenfield, focus heavily on:
- Architectural principles and design patterns
- Technology stack selection with rationale
- Phased build approach (MVP → Full Features)
- Integration points with existing infrastructure
- Scalability and extensibility considerations

[Include rest of standard prompt sections]
```

### For Major Feature Enhancements

```
Create a Master Vision Document for adding [FEATURE_NAME] to the existing [PROJECT_NAME] system.

Since this is an enhancement, focus heavily on:
- Integration points with existing architecture
- Required refactoring of current implementation
- Migration strategy (current → future state)
- Backward compatibility requirements
- Testing strategy for existing + new functionality

Current System Context:
[Describe existing system architecture, tech stack, and constraints]

[Include rest of standard prompt sections]
```

### For System Refactors/Redesigns

```
Create a Master Vision Document for refactoring [SYSTEM_NAME] from [OLD_APPROACH] to [NEW_APPROACH].

Since this is a refactor, focus heavily on:
- Current state analysis (what exists, what's broken)
- Detailed "Before/After" architecture diagrams
- Migration strategy with rollback plans
- Data migration and backwards compatibility
- Risk mitigation for disruption

Current Pain Points:
- [Problem 1]
- [Problem 2]
- [Problem 3]

[Include rest of standard prompt sections]
```

### For Multi-Agent Systems

```
Create a Master Vision Document for [MULTI_AGENT_SYSTEM_NAME].

Since this involves autonomous agents, focus heavily on:
- Agent architecture and communication patterns
- Task delegation and coordination workflows
- Agent specialization and capabilities
- Inter-agent protocols and message types
- Learning and improvement mechanisms
- Failure handling and recovery

Agent Roles Needed:
- [Agent 1]: [Responsibilities]
- [Agent 2]: [Responsibilities]
- [Agent 3]: [Responsibilities]

[Include rest of standard prompt sections]
```

### For Infrastructure Projects

```
Create a Master Vision Document for [INFRASTRUCTURE_PROJECT_NAME].

Since this is infrastructure, focus heavily on:
- Deployment architecture (k8s, cloud, on-prem)
- Security and isolation requirements
- Resource quotas and multi-tenancy
- Monitoring, logging, and observability
- Disaster recovery and backup strategies
- Cost optimization and scaling

Infrastructure Requirements:
- [Requirement 1]
- [Requirement 2]
- [Requirement 3]

## Prompt Refinement Questions

After receiving the initial vision document, use these follow-up prompts to refine:

### Deepen Technical Detail

```
The vision document looks good. Now I need you to expand the following sections with more technical depth:

1. **[Section Name]**: I need [specific detail you want]
2. **[Section Name]**: Add [specific aspect missing]

Specifically address:
- [Technical concern 1]
- [Technical concern 2]
```

### Add Implementation Guidance

```
Add a new section called "Implementation Playbook" that provides:

1. **Phase [N] Execution Steps:**
   - Detailed task breakdown
   - File-by-file changes needed
   - Testing approach for each task
   - Validation checkpoints

2. **Common Pitfalls:**
   - [Area of concern 1]
   - [Area of concern 2]

3. **Decision Trees:**
   - If [condition], then [approach A], else [approach B]
```

### Capture Architecture Decisions

```
I need you to add Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for:

1. **[Decision Area]**: Why did we choose [X] over [Y]?
2. **[Decision Area]**: What are the tradeoffs of [approach]?
3. **[Decision Area]**: What alternatives were considered?

For each, include:
- Context (why decision needed)
- Options considered (pros/cons)
- Decision made
- Technical impact
- Open questions
```

### Add Roadmap Detail

```
Expand the roadmap section to include:

1. **Dependencies:** What must be done before Phase [N]?
2. **Parallel Work:** What can be done simultaneously?
3. **Risk Factors:** What could delay or block phases?
4. **Resource Needs:** What skills/tools needed per phase?
5. **Validation Gates:** How do we know each phase is complete?
```

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Provide Rich Context:** The more context you give about existing systems, constraints, and goals, the better the vision document

2. **Iterate in Layers:** Start with high-level, then ask for deeper technical detail in specific sections

3. **Use Existing Artifacts:** Reference existing docs, code, or diagrams Claude Code can read

4. **Be Explicit About Unknowns:** If there are areas where decisions haven't been made, call them out

5. **Specify Autonomy Level:** Tell Claude how much it should design vs. flag for human decision

6. **Update Regularly:** Treat the vision doc as living - update it as implementation reveals new insights

7. **Link to Implementation:** Reference specific file paths, functions, or components in the vision doc so Claude Code can navigate easily

## Example Usage

```bash
# In Claude Code session:

"I need to create a vision document for the new RAG system I'm building.

Context:
I'm adding a dual-path RAG system (vector + graph) to my platform. 
It needs to support multi-tenancy with company-scoped namespaces, 
and integrate with existing team architecture. Current retrieval is 
basic vector search in Pinecone, but I need richer context and 
relationship traversal.

Use the template at /docs/VISION_TEMPLATE.md

Focus heavily on:
- Multi-tenant isolation architecture
- Integration with existing Team Factory
- Query routing logic (when to use vector vs graph)
- Data ingestion pipelines

[Provide full standard prompt with these customizations]"
```
